          <p class="medium">City Sound Walks</p>
        I was invited by <a href="https://faber.ro/en/homepage/" target="_blank">FABER</a> & Martina Muzi to create a workshop and exhibition that would help to connect refugees from Ukraine with the city of Timișoara and the people already living there. I devised a series of sound walks from which we collectively explored Timisoara through sound; using the recordings and objects gathered to create an alternative map of the city together.
