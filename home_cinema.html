        The importance of spaces for watching together in the community is made even more poignant today by the fact that it is easier than ever to stay at home and watch something privately. What new ways of seeing and being are being produced because of this phenomenon?

        You can snuggle up completely alone in your bed and watch (or deliberate about watching) an endless selection of films. Or you might be surrounded by sweating people in suits while you watch the latest series on your journey home from work. Peering over your shoulder someone catches the one time only silent screening of that series on a 138.3mm x 67.1mm screen.

        <p>

        Not sure if this project is more poignant or more trivial now?! It seems surreal that back in January we were snuggled up in a bed in a gallery space watching films on a giant laptop and the original project text reads kind of strangely but the question remains: What new ways of seeing are being produced because of these circumstances? The installation hosted a series of videos around the topic of home viewing at MaMA Rotterdam.
