          <p class="medium" >Flags van Vreewijk</p>
        I was invited by Janneke and Eros to contribute to their research project in the neighbourhood of Vreewijk, Rotterdam South. Started in 1919 and completed just after the second world war, Vreewijk is like a village in the city. On my first visit I was struck by how active the community spaces still were, it reminded me of home. Janneke and Eros told me of all the previous communal infrastructure that used to be there, a shared bath house, a pigeon coup on the roof. Perhaps these physical spaces were no longer relevant for contemporary community life but there were stories tied up in these places.
        <p>
        One such infrastructure which is prevalent throughout the Netherlands is the flag pole holders on the facades of buildings. Officially they are there to hold the national flag on specific days (there are rules on when and how the can be flown). The simple premise of the project then was to use this readily available infrastructure, not for national sentiment but to communicate the local stories past and present. To fly them proudly in the streets, to start conversation about how the community lived there historically and how that could continue today.
        <p>
        A workshop with residence of the neighbourhood worked through their stories to transform them into a series of flags that were then paraded through the street and hosted at various locations and households.
