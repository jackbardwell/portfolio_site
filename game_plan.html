<p>
        Exhibition design, while at Thomas.Matthews for ‘Game Plan’ an exhibition about the 500 year history of board games at the V&A Museum of Childhood.
        Board games are played by everyone, young and old. They have a universal appeal that transcends cultural and language barriers. They can both teach and entertain us. Designing the exhibition as a giant walk through game meant all of this could be expressed in the experience, while simply displaying the beautifully detailed objects. The gameboard grid throughout the exhbition led to the creation of a split batton panel system that allowed the exhbition to travel to different locations around the UK.
