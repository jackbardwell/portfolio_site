          <div class="column_cv left_cv">About</div> 
          <div class="column_cv right_cv">This website is a growing archive of my work, which includes small stand alone pieces, writing, radio making and installation work as well as more traditional spatial design projects often in the form of exhibition design, which I completed at Thomas.Matthews studio in London. The project The School within The School won the 2019 KABK Master’s Prize and has been featured in various research projects on experimental education including the Future Architecture Platform. My spatial design work has been featured in Creative Review in the UK and was awarded the Ones to Watch award from the Design council, UK.<p>

          You can watch a video that I made for Falmouth University about my practice <a href="https://youtu.be/VHlJrP9YmeE">here</a><p> 

          Since initiating Mushroom Radio at the KABK making radio has become a large part of my practice. I have helped initiate many independent internet radio stations across Europe specifically at art and design schools. 

          I co-founded <a href="https://goodtimesbadtimes.club/" target="_blank">Good Times Bad Times</a> radio station in Rotterdam with <a href="https://www.bnjmnearl.eu/">Benjamin Earl</a> and <a href="https://kirstenspruit.com/">Kirsten Spruit</a>. As well as a developing an archive of interviews with the art and design scene we have created unique radio programmes for institutions or exhibitions such as Het Niuew Insituute Rotterdam, CBK Rotterdam and The Water School with Makkink and Bey.<p>

          Education is a large part of my practice, I have taught and given workshops and talks on radio and education itself throughout Europe including Design Academy Eindhoven, Falmouth University, HyperWerk Institute, Switzerland and Central St Martins, London. At the Royal Academy of Art The Hague I initiated the Inter-masters peer-to-peer support group Group Therapy which has lead to the development of the Masters Collaborative Programme at the Academy. You can read about it in an interview published on <a href="https://www.mistermotley.nl/van-een-university-of-the-arts-naar-een-pluriversity-of-the-arts-in-gesprek-met-jack-bardwell/" target="_blank">Mister Motley Magazine</a><p>

          My Latest project, which is supported by Stimuleringsfonds explores internet radio culture and a possible future trajectory for this developing scene. It will take the form of a new piece of technology, installation and performance.<p>
